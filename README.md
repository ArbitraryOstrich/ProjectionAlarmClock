This project is my attempt at recreating the projecting bedroom clocks.

To do this I needed to secure a transparent screen that I can drive from the
esp32.

The screen I am trying to use is made by crystalFontz, the data sheet is
included in the DOCS folder as is the pinout for the particular esp32 board I'm
using 

I also added an aht Temp + Humidity sensor to the package.
